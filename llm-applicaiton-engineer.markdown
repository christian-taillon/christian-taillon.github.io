# Quantization Interview Questions

### Q1: Walk through the process of quantizing a 16-bit model to 4-bit using GGML/GGUF. What considerations and tradeoffs would you make?

**Key Points to Look For:**
- Understanding of quantization methods:
  ```python
  # Example approach
  k-means quantization
  Round-to-nearest
  Group-size selection
  Weight distribution analysis
  ```
- Hardware-specific optimizations:
  ```
  • CPU: ARM vs x86 considerations
  • Memory alignment
  • SIMD instruction sets
  • Cache-friendly layouts
  ```
- Quality preservation techniques:
  ```
  • Layer-wise quantization
  • Activation aware quantization
  • Calibration dataset selection
  • Critical layer preservation
  ```
- Performance measurement:
  ```
  • Perplexity comparison
  • Inference speed benchmarks
  • Memory usage profiling
  • Quality-size tradeoffs
  ```

### Q2: Compare these quantization approaches for a production system (explain the tradeoffs of each):

A) Post-training quantization with INT8 <br>
B) QLoRA fine-tuning with 4-bit base <br>
C) AWQ (Activation-aware Weight Quantization)<br>
D) GPTQ with different group sizes<br>

**Key Points to Look For:**
- Practical implementation knowledge:
  ```
  • Memory requirements
  • Training complexity
  • Inference speed
  • Accuracy impact
  ```
- Hardware considerations:
  ```
  • GPU memory bandwidth
  • CPU SIMD utilization
  • Power consumption
  • Deployment constraints
  ```
- Use case optimization:
  ```
  • Latency requirements
  • Quality thresholds
  • Resource constraints
  • Scaling needs
  ```

**Example Metrics to Discuss:**
Ah, you're absolutely right - I apologize for that error. Let me correct the metrics table:

Yes, that's much clearer! Here are two distinct tables:

```
Precision Formats
Format     | Memory   | Speed     | Quality    | Use Case Example
FP32       | 32-bit   | Slowest   | Best       | Training, Quality benchmarking
BF16       | 16-bit   | Fast      | Excellent  | Training, Modern GPUs
FP16       | 16-bit   | Fast      | Very Good  | GPU inference
INT8       | 8-bit    | Faster    | Good       | CPU deployment
INT4       | 4-bit    | Fastest   | Degraded   | Edge devices
```
<br>
```
Quantization Methods
Method     | Target    | Speed     | Quality    | Implementation Complexity
PTQ        | INT8/4    | Fast      | Good       | Low (post-training only)
QLoRA      | 4-bit     | Medium    | Very Good* | High (requires fine-tuning)
AWQ        | 4-bit     | Fast      | Better     | Medium (calibration needed)
GPTQ       | 3-4 bit   | Fast      | Good       | Medium (group quantization)
SpQR       | 4-bit     | Fast      | Better     | High (emerging technique)
```

*Note: Methods can be combined (e.g., AWQ + QLoRA) and actual results depend heavily on:
*Note: QLoRA maintains good quality during fine-tuning despite low precision by using a technique called Low-Rank Adaptation, but it's not better than the original FP32 model.

The general principle is:
- Higher precision (32-bit, 16-bit) = Better quality but more memory/slower
- Lower precision (8-bit, 4-bit) = Slightly degraded quality but faster/less memory

**Red Flags:**
- Not understanding memory alignment requirements
- Ignoring hardware-specific optimizations
- Lack of knowledge about calibration
- No experience with quantization debugging
- Unfamiliarity with common failure modes

**Bonus Points:**
- Experience with custom quantization schemes
- Understanding of mixed precision approaches
- Knowledge of emerging techniques (SpQR, OmniQuant)
- Hardware-specific optimization experience
