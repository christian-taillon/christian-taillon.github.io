## What are some common malware locations?
- **Startup Folder**: Malware often places shortcuts or files in the Startup folder to run automatically every time Windows starts up. The path to this folder is typically:
    - `C:\Users\[Username]\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\Windows\Start Menu\Programs\Startup`
    - `C:\ProgramData\Microsoft\Windows\Start Menu\Programs\Startup`

- **System Folder**: The System32 folder contains files that are essential to your Windows OS. Some malware tries to disguise itself by using similar names to legitimate files in this folder. The path is:
    - `C:\Windows\System32`

- **Temporary Files**: Malware often hides in the temporary files folder. The location for this folder is typically:
    - `C:\Users\[Username]\AppData\Local\Temp`
    - `C:\Temp`
- **AppData Folder**: This folder is used by applications to store settings, files, and data and is another common location for malware. The typical path is:
    - `C:\Users\[Username]\AppData`

- **Download Folder**: This is the default location for downloads from the internet. Always be cautious about what is in this folder.
    - `C:\Users\[Username]\Downloads`

- **Program Files and Program Files (x86)**: These folders are where applications are typically installed. Malware often hides in these locations, especially in less commonly used subfolders. The paths are:
    - `C:\Program Files`
    - `C:\Program Files (x86)`

- **Browser Profiles**: Malware can also hide in the user data or profile directories of web browsers. Here are locations for some common browsers:
    - Chrome: `C:\Users\[Username]\AppData\Local\Google\Chrome\User Data\Default`
    - Firefox: `C:\Users\[Username]\AppData\Roaming\Mozilla\Firefox\Profiles`
    - Edge: `C:\Users\[Username]\AppData\Local\Microsoft\Edge\User Data\Default`

- **Documents Folder**: This is a common location where users store files. Malware can sometimes be found here, often disguised as a document or hidden in a subfolder. The typical path is:
    - `C:\Users\[Username]\Documents`

- **Windows PowerShell Modules**: Malware might attempt to use PowerShell scripts and could leave traces in PowerShell module directories. A common location to check is:
    - `C:\Users\[Username]\Documents\WindowsPowerShell\Modules`

## What are some common malware Registry persistence locations?
- `HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run`
- `HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run`
- `HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\RunOnce`
- `HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\RunOnce`
- `HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Policies\Explorer\Run`
- `HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Policies\Explorer\Run`
- `HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\Winlogon\Userinit`
- `HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\Winlogon\Shell`
- `HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services`
- `HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\RunServices`
- `HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\RunServices`

## List other locations that may be interesting or useful to a Threat Hunter.
- **Auto-start Extension Points (ASEPs)**: Registry keys used to automatically start a program during or after booting. In addition to the `Run` and `RunOnce` keys mentioned earlier, you might want to check these locations as well:
    - `HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Explorer\User Shell Folders`
    - `HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Explorer\User Shell Folders`
    - `HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Explorer\Shell Folders`
    - `HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Explorer\StartupApproved\Run`
    - `HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Explorer\StartupApproved\Run`
    - `HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Explorer\StartupApproved\StartupFolder`
    - `HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Explorer\StartupApproved\StartupFolder`
    - `HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\Windows\AppInit_DLLs`
    - `HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\Windows\Load`
    - `HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\Windows\Run`

- **Services**: Malware can also create or modify Windows service entries. You might want to check these locations:
    - `HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\System\CurrentControlSet\Services`

- **Internet Explorer**: Modifications to Internet Explorer settings could be a sign of certain types of malware. Relevant keys include:
    - `HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Microsoft\Internet Explorer`
    - `HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Internet Explorer`

- **Browser Helper Objects (BHOs)**: These are DLLs that Internet Explorer loads each time it starts up. Some types of malware install themselves as BHOs.
    - `HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Explorer\Browser Helper Objects`

- **Windows Sockets (Winsock)**: Malware might install a Layered Service Provider (LSP) to manipulate network traffic.
    - `HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\System\CurrentControlSet\Services\WinSock2\Parameters\Protocol_Catalog9\Catalog_Entries`
    - `HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\System\CurrentControlSet\Services\WinSock2\Parameters\NameSpace_Catalog5\Catalog_Entries`

- **Known DLLs**: Malware may insert entries into the Known DLLs list to ensure they're loaded into memory.
    - `HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\System\CurrentControlSet\Control\Session Manager\KnownDLLs`

- **Security Providers**: Malware can add illegitimate security providers to this list.
    - `HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\SecurityProviders`

- **Shell Open Command**: Malware often modifies these keys to execute whenever a certain file type is opened.
    - `HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\*\shell\open\command`
    - `HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\*\shellex\ContextMenuHandlers`
    - `HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\Drive\shell\open\command`

- **Image File Execution Options**: Used for debugging, but can be abused for persistence.
    - `HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\Image File Execution Options`

- **Scheduled Tasks**: Malware can create scheduled tasks for persistence.
    - `HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\Schedule\TaskCache`

## Ten Open Ended Threat Hunting Questions
1. Can you explain the difference between Threat Hunting and Incident Response and Traditional SOC Triage? How do they work together?

2. In your experience, which are the most reliable indicators of compromise (IoCs)? What are some of the least reliable?

3. Can you explain a situation where you used behavioral analysis to identify a potential threat? What techniques or tools did you use?

4. How do you use threat intelligence feeds in your threat hunting process? Can you provide an example of how you've used this data to improve your organization's security posture?

5. How would you go about investigating a potential Advanced Persistent Threat (APT)? What are some unique challenges associated with hunting for these threats and how do you address them?

6. How familiar are you with creating custom scripts or using automation to assist with threat hunting? Can you share a specific example where this improved your work?

7. Can you talk about a time when your hunt resulted in a false positive or multiple false positives? How did you determine it was a false positive and what was your subsequent action?

8. How do you ensure that threat hunting activities are effective and that you're not duplicating SOC Triage work?

9. Can you discuss some of your favorite tools to use in any domain of threat hunting?

10. Assume a situation where a threat bypassed existing security control, you can choose what type of control has been bypassed. What steps would you take to identify, isolate, and mitigate it? How would you prevent threats of a similar nature in the future?

## Modern Threat Hunting Concepts
What is the MITRE ATT&CK Framework and how do you use it in threat hunting?
```
A globally accessible knowledge base of adversary tactics and techniques based on real-world observations. Used to understand adversary behavior, identify gaps in defenses, and structure hunting methodologies.
```

What are some common hunting methodologies?
```
Hypothesis-driven hunting | Intelligence-driven hunting | Alert-driven hunting | Anomaly-driven hunting
```

How do you measure the effectiveness of threat hunting activities?
```
Mean Time to Detection (MTTD) | Number of true positives identified | Hunting coverage metrics | Reduction in false positives | Improvement in detection rules
```

What is adversary emulation and how does it benefit threat hunting?
```
Simulating real-world adversary behaviors to test defenses and hunting capabilities. Helps validate detection capabilities and identify blind spots.
```

What are some common data sources used in threat hunting?
```
Endpoint logs | Network traffic | DNS logs | Proxy logs | Email logs | Authentication logs | Process execution logs | Registry changes | File system changes
```

```

What are some indicators of lateral movement you would look for?
```
Multiple authentication failures followed by a success | Unusual access patterns to sensitive accounts | SMB/Windows admin shares access from non-admin systems | Unusual RPC/DCOM activity | Kerberos ticket anomalies
```

How would you hunt for credential dumping activities?
```
Monitor for LSASS process access | Look for use of tools like Mimikatz | Analyze for unusual memory access patterns | Monitor for credential access APIs | Check for registry access to SAM hive
```

What techniques would you use to hunt for data exfiltration?
```
Analyze network traffic for unusual data volumes | Look for connections to known bad IPs/domains | Monitor for use of file transfer protocols | Check for compression/encryption of large data sets | Analyze DNS tunneling indicators
```

How do you approach hunting in cloud environments?
```
Monitor for unusual API activity | Look for privilege escalation attempts | Analyze for misconfigurations | Monitor for unusual data access patterns | Check for unauthorized resource deployments
```

## Open to PRs!!
This list is a work in progress as I have never conducted an interview for a Threat Hunting position on any of my teams. Initial thoughts were to keep it very open ended, but I'd like to add true / false and multiple choice questions. Ping me if you have thoughts at [christiantaillon@pm.me](mailto:christiantaillon@pm.me).
