It is recommended that you brew a cup of coffee to enjoy while accessing this site. It dramatically improves the experience on the web. ðŸ˜‰

In the rapidly evolving landscape of Cybersecurity, our work demands persistence, proactivity, and collaboration. I truly believe that you donâ€™t need to work at the same company to be on the same team. 

On this website, you'll find resources, blogs, and articles on a variety of topics related to Information Security and now Artificial Intelligence. Whether you're just getting started or are already on your journey in these domains, I hope you'll find this platform to be a treasure trove of information and learning.

If you are here hoping to access resources related to a talk I gave, you can likely find what you are looking for through the navigation bar. While most of my resources are hosted in repositories on GitHub, I direct people to relevant content through this site.
