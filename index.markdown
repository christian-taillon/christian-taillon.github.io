It is recommended that you brew a cup of coffee to enjoy while accessing this site. It dramatically improves the experience on the web. ðŸ˜‰

In the rapidly evolving landscape of Cybersecurity, our work demands persistence, proactivity, and collaboration. I truly believe that you donâ€™t need to work at the same company to be on the same team.

### Purpose for this Site
<div class="justify-text" align = "justify">
From the very start of my career, I have always found myself the beneficiary of those taking time to create collections of resources, cheatsheets, and guides for various technologies I've worked with. I want to do the same for others through this simple site.

On this website, you'll find resources, blogs, and articles on a variety of topics related to Information Security and Artificial Intelligence. Whether you're just getting started or are already on your journey in these domains, I hope you'll find this platform to be useful to you.
