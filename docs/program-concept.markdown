### Programming Concepts Explained with Code Examples

#### Variable Assignments
Variables are named locations used to store data in memory. An assignment statement assigns a value to a variable. In the script, `coffee_price` and `budget` are examples of variable assignments.

```python
# Variable Assignments
coffee_price = 5  # Assigning the price of one coffee
budget = 0  # Initializing budget to 0
```

#### Functions, Procedures, Calls
Functions encapsulate a block of code that performs a specific task and can be called from other parts of the program. The `get_number_of_coffees` function calculates how many coffees can be bought within a given budget.

```python
def get_number_of_coffees(budget, price_per_coffee):
    # Function body
```

#### Logic Decisions and Branching
Conditional statements (`if`, `else`) allow the program to execute different blocks of code based on certain conditions. This concept is demonstrated when deciding if the user's budget is sufficient to buy any coffee.

```python
if budget < price_per_coffee:
    # Condition met
else:
    # Condition not met
```

#### Loops
Loops repeat a block of code multiple times. The `while` loop in `get_number_of_coffees` keeps buying coffee until the budget is depleted.

```python
while budget >= price_per_coffee:
    budget -= price_per_coffee
    number_of_coffees += 1
```

#### Debugging Techniques
Debugging is the process of finding and fixing errors in code. The script uses logging for debugging, which is a more advanced and flexible technique compared to simple print statements.

```python
logging.debug(f"Debug: Budget entered is {budget}")
```

#### Importing and Configuring Logging
The script starts by importing the `logging` module and setting up the basic configuration. This demonstrates how to incorporate external libraries and configure them for use in a program.

```python
import logging
logging.basicConfig(level=logging.DEBUG, format='%(asctime)s - %(levelname)s - %(message)s')
```

#### Error Handling with Logging
Using `try-except` blocks for error handling and logging errors when they occur is crucial for robust programs. This technique allows the program to gracefully handle unexpected inputs or situations.

```python
try:
    budget = float(input("Enter your budget for coffee: "))
except ValueError:
    logging.error("Invalid input for budget. Please enter a numeric value.")
```

# Full Python Script
```python
import logging

# Variable Assignments
coffee_price = 2.50
num_cups = 5

# Logic Decisions and Branching
if coffee_price < 3.00:
    print("I'll take two cups!")
else:
    print("Too expensive for me.")

# Functions, Procedures, Calls
def brew_coffee():
    print("Brewing coffee...")

brew_coffee()

# Loops
for cup in range(3):
    print("Brewing cup", cup+1)

# Debugging Techniques
logging.basicConfig(level=logging.DEBUG)

def brew_coffee(cups):
    logging.debug("Brewing %d cups of coffee...", cups)

brew_coffee("two")

# Simple and Compound Conditions within a Programming
if num_cups >= 3 and coffee_price < 3.00:
    print("Let's have a coffee break!")
```
