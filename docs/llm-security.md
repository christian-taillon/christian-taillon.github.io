## Pickle Serialization

**Overview:**
Pickle is a Python serialization module that converts objects to a binary byte stream using opcodes. These opcodes are low-level instructions that reconstruct objects during deserialization.

**Security Warning:**
The pickle format is inherently risky because its opcodes can execute arbitrary code. An attacker could craft a malicious pickle stream that runs harmful Python commands when unpickled, making it a significant security vulnerability.

## PyTorch Framework

**Technical Description:**
PyTorch is a computational framework for neural network development, enabling dynamic computational graph construction and efficient machine learning model training. Its flexible Python-native architecture supports advanced research in deep learning, computer vision, and artificial intelligence by providing sophisticated tensor manipulation and GPU-accelerated computational capabilities.
