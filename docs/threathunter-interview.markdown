## Ten Threat Hunting Questions
This list is a work in progress as I have never conducted an interview for a Threat Hunting postion on any of my teams. Initial thoughts were to keep it very open ended, but I'd like to add true / false and multiple choice questions. Ping me if you have thoughts at [christiantaillon@pm.me](mailto:christiantaillon@pm.me).

1. Can you explain the difference between Threat Hunting and Incident Response? How do they work together in a cybersecurity framework?

2. In your experience, which are the most reliable indicators of compromise (IoCs)? How do you ensure you don't miss these signs during threat hunting?

3. Can you explain a situation where you used behavioral analysis to identify a potential threat? What techniques or tools did you use?

4. How do you use threat intelligence feeds in your threat hunting process? Can you provide an example of how you've used this data to improve your organization's security posture?

5. How would you go about investigating a potential Advanced Persistent Threat (APT)? What are some unique challenges associated with these threats and how do you address them?

6. How familiar are you with creating custom scripts or using automation to assist with threat hunting? Can you share a specific example where this improved your work?

7. Can you talk about a time when you identified a false positive? How did you determine it was a false positive and what was your subsequent action?

8. How do you ensure that threat hunting activities don't interfere with regular operations in your organization?

9. Can you discuss your experience with sandboxing and how it aids in threat hunting? Can you give an example of a situation where it was particularly effective?

10. Given a situation where a threat bypassed existing security measures, what steps would you take to identify, isolate, and mitigate it? How would you prevent similar threats in the future?
