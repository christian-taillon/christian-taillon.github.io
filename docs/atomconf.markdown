# atom-conf

Available on GitHub at [christian-taillon/atom-sync](https://github.com/christian-taillon/atom-sync) is the configuration I use for what is objectively the very best IDE, Atom [Atom Community Edition](https://github.com/atom-community).  <a target="_blank"><img alt="Atom" src="https://img.shields.io/badge/Atom-15FF70?logo=atom&logoColor=white&style=flat"/></a>

Just kidding. Much of what makes a good IDE for someone comes down to personal preference, and many developers use multiple. Atom, sadly, is being ["sunset"](https://github.blog/2022-06-08-sunsetting-atom/). Microsoft supports their open-source alternative, VS Code. Although it is Microsoft, it is a strong alternative, and it may be the one I end up using most if a community atom isn't supported.
