# Pulsar and Atom Conf

Although [GitHub sunset Atom](https://github.blog/2022-06-08-sunsetting-atom/), the project lives on!

The community has rallied and is continuing to support the ide at [pulsar-edit.dev](https://pulsar-edit.dev/). Check it out! I also have made available my configuration for Pulsar Edit. It is available on GitHub as a Gist at [christian-taillon/pulsar-conf](https://gist.github.com/christian-taillon/618980c972776181974c6c062d7e8408).

This may be a great starting place for you.
