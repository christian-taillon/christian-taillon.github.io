#### Real-time & Scheduled Scanning with ClamAV

#### Real-time Scanning:

Utilize the `clamav-daemon` to implement real-time scanning.

```bash
sudo systemctl status clamav-daemon
```

#### Scheduled Scanning:

To automate scans, leverage the `cron` job scheduler:

1. **Access Crontab**:
   ```bash
   crontab -e
   ```

2. **Schedule the Scan**:

   For instance, to automate a daily scan of the `/home` directory at 2 AM:
   ```
   0 2 * * * clamscan -r /home >> /path/to/logfile.log
   ```

Ensure to modify `/path/to/logfile.log` to your desired log location.

#### Clamscan vs. Clamdscan: What's the difference?

- **clamscan**: This is ClamAV's primary command-line scanner. It operates autonomously, scanning files or directories for malware. However, its modus operandi involves reloading the virus database each time, which can introduce latency for extensive scans.

- **clamdscan**: Acting as a client for the `clamd` daemon, this doesn't reload the virus database. Instead, it liaises with `clamd`, utilizing its persistently loaded database. This mode is generally more efficient for regular or large-scale scans.

#### Freshclam: The Database Refresher

- **Standard Usage**: Revitalize the virus database.
   ```bash
   freshclam
   ```

- **Daemon Mode**: Enables routine checks for database updates.
   ```bash
   freshclam --daemon
   ```

- **Configuration Customization**:
   ```bash
   freshclam --config-file=/path/to/config.conf
   ```

- **Database Download Location**:
   ```bash
   freshclam --datadir=~/Downloads/rules/
   ```

---

#### Clamscan: Your Malware Sleuth

- **Basic Scan**: Sweep a directory for potential threats.
   ```bash
   clamscan ~/Downloads/malware/
   ```

- **Recursive Scan**: Dive deep into directories, leaving no stone unturned.
   ```bash
   clamscan -r ~/Downloads/malware/
   ```

- **Filter to Infected**:
   ```bash
   clamscan -i -r ~/Downloads/malware/
   ```

- **Database Direction**:
   ```bash
   clamscan -d ~/Downloads/rules/ -r ~/Downloads/malware/
   ```

- **Purge Infected Files** (Exercise caution):
   ```bash
   clamscan --remove -r ~/Downloads/malware/
   ```

---

#### Clamdscan: The Daemon's Whisperer

- **Default Scan**: Employ `clamd` to inspect a directory.
   ```bash
   clamdscan ~/Downloads/malware/
   ```

- **Highlight Infected Only**:
   ```bash
   clamdscan -i ~/Downloads/malware/
   ```

- **Streaming Mode** (Ideal for debugging purposes):
   ```bash
   clamdscan --stream ~/Downloads/malware/
   ```
