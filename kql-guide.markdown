## Basic Concepts

### Data Structure
KQL works with tabular data where:
- **Tables**: Contain rows of data
- **Columns**: Named fields in each row
- **Operators**: Transform or filter data
- **Functions**: Perform calculations or transformations

### Basic Query Structure
```kql
TableName
| where ColumnName == "value"
| project Column1, Column2
| limit 100
```

## Operators

### Comparison Operators
```kql
// Equality
SecurityEvent
| where EventID == 4625

// Inequality
SecurityEvent
| where EventID != 4624

// Greater/Less than
SecurityEvent
| where EventID > 4620
SecurityEvent
| where EventID < 4630

// Contains/Substrings
SecurityEvent
| where AccountName contains "admin"
SecurityEvent
| where Message startswith "Logon"
```

### Logical Operators
```kql
// AND operator
SecurityEvent
| where EventID == 4625 and AccountName contains "admin"

// OR operator
SecurityEvent
| where EventID == 4625 or EventID == 4624

// NOT operator
SecurityEvent
| where EventID != 4625

// Complex logic
SecurityEvent
| where (EventID == 4625 or EventID == 4624) and AccountName !contains "system"
```

### Range Operations
```kql
// Between values (inclusive)
SecurityEvent
| where EventID between (4620 .. 4630)

// In list
SecurityEvent
| where EventID in (4624, 4625, 4634, 4647)

// Not in list
SecurityEvent
| where EventID !in (4624, 4625)
```

## String Operations

### String Matching
```kql
// Case-sensitive contains
SecurityEvent
| where Message contains_cs "failed"

// Case-insensitive contains
SecurityEvent
| where Message contains "FAILED"

// Regular expressions
SecurityEvent
| where AccountName matches regex @"\w+admin\w*"

// Exact match
SecurityEvent
| where AccountType == "User"
```

### String Functions
```kql
// Extract substring
SecurityEvent
| extend Domain = substring(AccountName, 0, indexof(AccountName, "\\"))
| extend Username = substring(AccountName, indexof(AccountName, "\\") + 1)

// String replacement
SecurityEvent
| extend CleanMessage = replace_string(Message, "Error", "Issue")

// String concatenation
SecurityEvent
| extend FullName = strcat(AccountName, " @ ", Computer)
```

## Time Operations

### Time Filters
```kql
// Last 24 hours
SecurityEvent
| where TimeGenerated > ago(24h)

// Specific time range
SecurityEvent
| where TimeGenerated between (datetime(2024-01-01) .. datetime(2024-01-31))

// Relative time
SecurityEvent
| where TimeGenerated > ago(1d) and TimeGenerated < ago(1h)

// Time formatting
SecurityEvent
| extend Hour = format_datetime(TimeGenerated, "HH:mm")
| extend Date = format_datetime(TimeGenerated, "yyyy-MM-dd")
```

### Time Calculations
```kql
// Time differences
SecurityEvent
| sort by TimeGenerated asc
| extend TimeDiff = prev(TimeGenerated, 1) - TimeGenerated

// Binning by time
SecurityEvent
| summarize Count = count() by bin(TimeGenerated, 1h)

// Time arithmetic
SecurityEvent
| extend FutureTime = TimeGenerated + 1d
| extend PastTime = TimeGenerated - 2h
```

## Aggregation Functions

### Count Operations
```kql
// Simple count
SecurityEvent
| summarize TotalEvents = count()

// Count by field
SecurityEvent
| summarize EventCount = count() by EventID

// Count distinct
SecurityEvent
| summarize UniqueComputers = dcount(Computer)
```

### Statistical Functions
```kql
// Basic statistics
SecurityEvent
| summarize
    Total = count(),
    Average = avg(EventID),
    Minimum = min(EventID),
    Maximum = max(EventID)
    by EventID

// Percentiles
SecurityEvent
| summarize
    P50 = percentile(TimeGenerated, 50),
    P95 = percentile(TimeGenerated, 95),
    P99 = percentile(TimeGenerated, 99)
```

### Advanced Aggregations
```kql
// Multiple aggregations
SecurityEvent
| summarize
    EventCount = count(),
    UniqueAccounts = dcount(AccountName),
    FirstSeen = min(TimeGenerated),
    LastSeen = max(TimeGenerated)
    by Computer, EventID

// Conditional aggregations
SecurityEvent
| summarize
    SuccessfulLogons = countif(EventID == 4624),
    FailedLogons = countif(EventID == 4625),
    TotalAttempts = count()
    by Computer
```

## Join Operations

### Inner Join
```kql
// Join security events with computer information
SecurityEvent
| join kind=inner (
    Heartbeat
    | project Computer, OSType, OSName
) on Computer
```

### Left Join
```kql
// Include all security events, add computer info where available
SecurityEvent
| join kind=leftouter (
    Heartbeat
    | project Computer, OSType, OSName
) on Computer
```

### Multiple Table Joins
```kql
// Join multiple tables for comprehensive view
SecurityEvent
| join kind=inner (
    Heartbeat
    | project Computer, OSType
) on Computer
| join kind=leftouter (
    Update
    | where Classification == "Security Updates"
    | summarize LastSecurityUpdate = max(PublishedDate) by Computer
) on Computer
```

## Security Use Cases

### Failed Login Analysis
```kql
SecurityEvent
| where EventID == 4625
| summarize
    FailedAttempts = count(),
    UniqueAccounts = dcount(AccountName),
    FirstFailure = min(TimeGenerated),
    LastFailure = max(TimeGenerated)
    by Computer, AccountName
| where FailedAttempts > 5
| order by FailedAttempts desc
```

### Account Lockout Investigation
```kql
SecurityEvent
| where EventID == 4740
| project TimeGenerated, Computer, AccountName, CallerComputerName
| join kind=leftouter (
    SecurityEvent
    | where EventID == 4625
    | where TimeGenerated > ago(1h)
    | summarize FailedAttempts = count() by AccountName, Computer
) on AccountName, Computer
| order by TimeGenerated desc
```

### Suspicious Process Detection
```kql
SecurityEvent
| where EventID == 4688
| where NewProcessName contains "powershell.exe"
| where CommandLine contains "-enc" or CommandLine contains "-encodedcommand"
| project TimeGenerated, Computer, AccountName, NewProcessName, CommandLine
| order by TimeGenerated desc
```

### Network Anomaly Detection
```kql
// High volume outbound connections
DeviceNetworkEvents
| where ActionType == "ConnectionSuccess"
| where RemoteIPType == "Public"
| summarize ConnectionCount = count() by DeviceName, RemoteIP
| where ConnectionCount > 100
| order by ConnectionCount desc
```

### Malware Investigation
```kql
DeviceFileEvents
| where ActionType == "FileCreated"
| where FolderPath contains "temp" or FolderPath contains "downloads"
| where FileName endswith ".exe"
| join kind=leftouter (
    DeviceProcessEvents
    | where ActionType == "ProcessCreated"
    | project DeviceName, FileName, ProcessCommandLine
) on DeviceName, FileName
| order by TimeGenerated desc
```

## Best Practices

### Performance Optimization
1. **Filter early**: Use `where` clauses as early as possible
2. **Limit results**: Use `limit` or `take` to reduce data volume
3. **Use appropriate operators**: Prefer `==` over `contains` when possible
4. **Avoid full scans**: Always include time filters

### Query Structure
1. **Start with table selection**
2. **Apply filters (where)**
3. **Transform data (extend/project)**
4. **Aggregate (summarize)**
5. **Sort and limit results**

### Common Patterns
```kql
// Investigation template
TableName
| where TimeGenerated > ago(24h)
| where ConditionField == "suspicious_value"
| extend AdditionalField = extract("regex", 0, RawData)
| summarize Count = count() by GroupField
| order by Count desc
| limit 100
```
